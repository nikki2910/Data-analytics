Performed data analysis on a dataset that contains the various causes of death around the globe (191 countries). Looked for data insights and visualized them using plotly and matlplotlib.
Surprisingly it has been found that the most common cause of death was Cardiovascular disease compared to Covid-19. The least common cause of deaths was Malaria.

The country with more deaths was China(10M) followed by India(8.9M). And the country with very few deaths was Niue(22),given the small population of this island, it is a reasonable number.
